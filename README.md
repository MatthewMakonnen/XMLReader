# XML Reader (INST 326 - Individual Project)

### Introduction
- This project is part of an exercise for the "Object-Oriented Programming for Information Science" course (INST 326).
- The project's main goal is to build an application that scrapes articles available on the Slate Magazine site (https://slate.com/) and lets the user select an article to get the article-specific URL.

### How To Run The Program

Packages to install before running the program files:
- requests
- feedparser

Steps of running the program (_xml_reader.py_):
1. Download the _xml_reader.py_ python file. 
2. Open and run the downloaded file through the Command Prompt (CMD).
3. When it lists all the available articles on the Slate Magazine site, enter the article number of the article you want to read.
4. After you receive the article-specific URL, enter yes to continue searching for more articles or no to end the program.
