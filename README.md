# XML Reader (INST 326 - Individual Project)

### Introduction
- This project is part of an exercise for the "Object-Oriented Programming for Information Science" course (INST 326).

The project's main goal is to build an application that scrapes articles available on the Slate Magazine site (https://slate.com/) and lets the user select an article to get the article-specific URL.
